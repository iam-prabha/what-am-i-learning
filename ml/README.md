# Machine Learning

Comprehensive machine learning implementations and examples using scikit-learn.

## 📁 Structure

### Supervised Learning
Algorithms that learn from labeled data:

- **linear_regression/** - Predicting continuous values
- **logistic_regression/** - Binary and multiclass classification
- **decision_tree/** - Tree-based decision making
- **random_forest/** - Ensemble of decision trees
- **svm/** - Support Vector Machines for classification
- **knn/** - K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm
- **naive_bayes/** - Probabilistic classification
