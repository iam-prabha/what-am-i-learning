# Data Structures & Algorithms

Implementation of fundamental data structures and algorithms in Python.

## 📁 Structure

### Data Structures
Common data structures implemented from scratch:

- **00_arrays_and_strings.py** - Array operations, string manipulation
- **01_linked_list.py** - Singly and doubly linked lists
- **02_stacks.py** - Stack implementation and applications
- **03_queue.py** - Queue, circular queue, deque
- **04_hash_tables.py** - Hash maps, collision handling
- **05_heap.py** - Min heap, max heap, priority queue

### Algorithms
Classic algorithms organized by category:

- **algorithms/sorting/** - Bubble, merge, quick, heap sort
- **algorithms/searching/** - Binary search, linear search
- **algorithms/graph/** - BFS, DFS, shortest path

## 🎯 Learning Path

1. Master basic data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues)
2. Understand hash tables and their applications
3. Learn tree and heap structures
4. Practice sorting algorithms
5. Explore graph algorithms

## 💡 Practice Tips

- Implement each data structure from scratch before using built-ins
- Analyze time and space complexity
- Solve problems on LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeForces
- Focus on understanding, not memorization
