## 📁 Contents

### Data Science Project Workflow
- **Data_sicence_project_workflow.ipynb** - Complete project template covering:
  - Data collection and loading
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Feature engineering
  - Model selection and training
  - Model evaluation and validation
  - Results interpretation and visualization

## 🎯 Project Structure

Each project follows the standard data science workflow:

1. **Problem Definition** - Understanding the business/research question
2. **Data Collection** - Gathering relevant data
3. **Data Exploration** - EDA with visualizations
4. **Data Preparation** - Cleaning, transformation, feature engineering
5. **Modeling** - Training and tuning models
6. **Evaluation** - Testing and validation
7. **Deployment** - Production-ready solutions
8. **Communication** - Presenting results

## 📊 Sample Datasets

Project datasets are stored in the `data/` subdirectory.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python** - Primary programming language
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation
- **NumPy** - Numerical computing
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** - Visualization
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning
- **TensorFlow** - Deep learning (if applicable)

## 💡 Best Practices

- Document your thought process and decisions
- Validate assumptions with statistical tests
- Use cross-validation for model evaluation
- Create reproducible pipelines
- Version control your code and data
- Write clear documentation
